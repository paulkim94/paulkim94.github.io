        <h3><u>Role</u></h3>
        <p>Web Developer, Programmer &amp; Designer</p>
        <h3><u>What's Virtue/Vice?</u></h3>
        <p>Vice/Virtue is a web application designed to help users keep
        track of habits by creating a habit and specifying the days and
        daily frequencies to commit to those habits.</p>
        <h3><u>The Process</u></h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preparation Phase</li>
            <p class="process-paragraph">The project was part of a Web Client
            Languages course. The course taught web programming and the languages
            used for web development such as HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, and AJAX.
            The course was more technical than design-oriented, so it involved
            more coding. Before working on the final project, which was Virtue/Vice,
            we worked on assignments that would prepare us.
            </p>
            <li>Wireframing</li>
            <p class="process-paragraph">Before the coding process, one of the
            assignments required my team to draw low-fidelity wireframes to have
            an idea of what to code later on. We drew the wireframes on paper and
            on a wireframing application, which facilitated the coding
            process later on.
            </p>
            <li>Web Application Development</li>
            <p class="process-paragraph">Once we had the wireframes, we dove
            straight into the coding and application development. We used Parse
            as our back-end to store user data. For the front-end, we used
            HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and AJAX.
            </p>
        </ol>
