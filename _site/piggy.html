        <h3><u>Role</u></h3>
        <p>Web Developer, Programmer &amp; Designer</p>

        <h3><u>What's Piggy?</u></h3>
        <p>Piggy is a mobile web application designed to aid users in saving
        money for a specific goal by a deadline. It aims to do the complex
        calculations and data analysis, so the user can focus on saving. As
        of now, it's only optimized for mobile view.</p>

        <h3><u>The Process</u></h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Needfinding</li>
            <p class="process-paragraph">The project was a result of a cognitive science course. The
            course was focused on interaction design and had multiple design
            studio options. I signed up for the Resolutions design studio,
            which involved designing an application that would solve any
            problem dealing with people failing to keep their resolutions.
            My team and I discussed the myriad of resolutions people make
            prior to New Year's Day, which included losing weight, working out,
            saving money, etc. We were interested in saving money and
            debated why people have a tough time saving money. We came to the conclusion
            that saving money was difficult because it involves complex
            calculations and planning. Also, keeping track of money isn't the
            most fun task to do. We decided that people needed an
            easier and more fun way to save money.</p>
            <li>Brainstorming Solutions</li>
            <p class="process-paragraph">My team and I brainstormed creative
            ways that we can solve the challenge of saving money. We agreed
            that since saving money requires complex calculations and planning,
            we would have to make it easy, fun, and user-friendly. In the end,
            we came up with an idea that our application
            should incentivize the user in some way for saving consistently.
            We decided to implement a reward system that would reward the user
             with virtual currency based on their savings progress.
            With the virtual currency, the user would be able to shop for items
            and dress a virtual avatar pig.</p>
            <li>Prototyping</li>
            <p class="process-paragraph">Once we decided on our solution, we
            made 2 paper prototypes. Each prototype was based on our solution,
            but different in layout, structure, information architecture, etc.
            We tested the paper prototypes on students in the same studio and
            made revisions based on feedback. We used an iterative method in
            modifying our prototypes.</p>
            <li>Application Development</li>
            <p class="process-paragraph">After testing the paper prototypes
            a few times, we took the feedback and created a final prototype
            that accounted for the feedback we received. Once we had the final
            prototype, we started the actual coding. The application development
            involved coding in HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and other languages.  We used
            an iterative method for the application development as well, constantly
            updating the website and improving it based on feedback.</p>
            <li>Testing &amp; Feedback</li>
            <p class="process-paragraph">Once our team had a working web application,
            we tested it on people outside of the class, including our friends,
            strangers, classmates, etc. Based on the feedback, we made modifications.
            In addition, we did A/B testing using Google Analytics to keep track of
            data such as click rates, duration that users are on a certain page, etc.</p>
        </ol>
